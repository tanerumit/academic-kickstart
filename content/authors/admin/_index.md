I am a water resources engineer and climate adaptation specialist at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl). I am currently a project manager/technical lead in several projects on resilient drinking water infrastructure, basin-scale climate risk assessment, and game design for strategic planning.  
 
Before joining Deltares, I was a researcher at the [UMass Hydrosystems Research Group](https://blogs.umass.edu/hydrosystems/), where I developed decision-making frameworks for water systems planning under long-term uncertainty. Previously, I was a research fellow at 
[US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-office-water), where I worked on watershed and water quality models. I have international work experience in various countries, including Turkey, USA, Canada, Peru, Nepal, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and Niger.
